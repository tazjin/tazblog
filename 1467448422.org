After my last [[https://tazj.in/en/1448315026][Kubernetes presentation]]
I gave one that was actually recorded. In my opinion Kubernetes is the
best way to orchestrate container infrastructure at the moment and I
whole-heartedly recommend everyone to look into it.

The video is available [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjkJ9P5yNPU][here]].

/Update 2017-11-13:/ Note that the presentation uses Kubernetes concepts
that are now outdated. You may want to find a newer resource.
