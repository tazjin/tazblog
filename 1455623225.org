A few weeks back I did a short presentation on servant, a Haskell
library for defining web APIs at the type level, at the Oslo Haskell
meetup.

Just in case somebody is interested you can grab the
[[https://git.tazj.in/tazjin/servant-presentation][slides]] and watch
the [[https://vimeo.com/153901805][video]].

The project presented in the slides, a little API for finding pubs in
Oslo, lives [[https://git.tazj.in/tazjin/pubkartet][here]]. I haven't
heard back from Untappd about an API key yet so things are a bit slow on
that front.
